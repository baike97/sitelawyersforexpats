						<h2>Services</h2>
						<h4>Business Transaction:</h4>
							<p>There are four principal channels of economy exchange and integration between nations in the modern era: Trade of goods, trade in services, foreign direct investment, and transfer of knowledge and technology. Our  focus is on private transaction in each of these four channels. Since the end of the Second World War, international trade  has been driving the process of globalization and integration of the world’s economy.</p>
						<h4>International Sale of Goods:</h4>
							<p>We understand the international sale of goods, and we deal with the basic expectation and risk of the seller and the buyer in any sales transaction. We focus on the transaction where the buyer and the seller are strangers without a prior course of dealing that has established  a level of trust and familiarity between the parties. We operates as facilitator making sure that all goes well. This type of transaction is becoming  increasingly common in modern age: Parties that wish to do  business together but that are not familiar with each other.</p>
						<h4>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) :</h4>
							<p>Growth in FDI has been one of the defining features of the world economy and globalization over the past 20years. FDI has grown at an unprecedented rate in the past two decades with only a slight retrenchment during the global economy downturn in the 1990s. The growth in FDI can be traced to increased liberalization  in laws and practices pertaining to foreign trade and investments, technological change, and growing competition.  This trend  indicates the growing importance of FDI in developing  countries and become  strongly oriented toward the service sector. FDI in electrical, gas and water, and telecommunications enjoyed the largest percentage increases, reflecting the widespread privatization and deregulation of the public utilities on a worldwide basis in the past decade.</p>
